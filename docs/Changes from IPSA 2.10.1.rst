Changes from IPSA 2.10.1
=========================

Converter driven plant functionality
--------------------------------------------
Updated CDP functionality


Groups in PyIPSA
--------------------------------
New groups functions in PyIPSA: ClearMembers, AddMember, RemoveMember, IsMember, CompareGroups, MergeGroups


Component Names in PyIPSA
--------------------------------
Component names can now be changed using the SetSValue functionality. Busbars can no longer have the same name which could cause small bugs.


Documentation fixes
--------------------------------------
The documentation has been fully reviewed and should be up to date -- removing some non-existent functions and adding previously undocumented functions.
Additionally the read-the-docs can be accessed in an off line form by downloading a pdf from the readthedocs website (it's prettier now)


Additional fixes
--------------------------------------
Multiple new methods added in PyIPSA for access functions (inc. CreateBranch()).
