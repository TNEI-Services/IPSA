   * - List[Float]
     - RealFaultCurrentpu
     - The list of defined real currents in per unit for each regime in the  while in the "defined fault" mode.
   * - List[Float]
     - ReactiveFaultCurrentpu
     - The list of defined reactive currents in per unit for each regime in the  while in the "defined fault" mode.
   * - Integer
     - ProfileUID
     - Gets and sets the UID of the profile applied to the universal machine. Set to 0 to not use any profiles.
   * - Integer
     - ModelMode
     - Gets and sets the model mode:

        - 0 = Current, D-Q
        - 1 = Current, Real-Imaginary

   * - Boolean
     - ConverterDrivenPlant
     - ``True`` if the universal machine is being used as a Converter Driven Plant (G74/2)
   * - Integer
     - CDPMethodType
     - The CDP current-output mode

        - 0 = Simple
        - 1 = Advanced
   * - Integer
     - CDPVoltageInterpolation
     - The CDP voltage interpolation scheme

        - 0 = Linear
        - 1 = Cubic
   * - Float
     - CDPKFactor
     - The K factor co-efficient that determines the strength of the current injection contributions (only valid between 0 and 10).
   * - Float
     - CDPMaxISync
     - Maximum synchronous value for the current injected given the time domains.
   * - Float
     - CDPMaxITrans
     - Maximum transient value for the current injected given the time domains.

     - Time constant value in ms for the transient window duration.
   * - Float
     - CDPTimeConstantSubTransientMs
     - Time constant value in ms for the subtransient window duration.
   * - Boolean
     - CDPPhaseCorrections
     - Switch for the CDP functionality of the universal machine that forces the phase correction of the injected current to be in
       quadrature with the pre-fault voltage. This 'prioritises' reactive power injection at the CDP injection site. In advanced mode,
       when this is disabled it will adopt the phase of the active-reactive current phasor. In simple mode, when this is disabled it
       will be in phase with the retained voltage.
   * - List[Float]
     - CDPVoltagePU
     - The list of (synchronous) voltage values in per unit for the CDP current injection (advanced method only).
